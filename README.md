# Foremost
1. download a linux iso
2. live boot it
3. or make a virtual machine
4. install `foremost` (e.g `apt install foremost` or `dnf install foremost`) or, before steps 1,2 and 3, download the source and/or binary of `foremost` and make a portable "kit". No need to do this though.
5. Transfer or insert (or pass trough if in a VM) the f-target (f as in forensic and target as in the disk or file that you want to extract from)
6. use `foremost on it`

⚠️ more details coming later
